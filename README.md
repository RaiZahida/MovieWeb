1. On page load, the app shows random movie suggestions.
2. The user can type a keyword to search for movies.
3. Clicking any movie opens a Bootstrap modal with full details (title, poster, genre, actors, plot, and IMDB rating).
4. A dropdown allows sorting the results based on year, rating, or popularity.
